# Gatherables

Gatherables are a quick way to get large amounts of destroyable objects with multiple states into a scene with zero code and no additional networked objects.

Gatherables are groups of interactable objects that players can destroy to receive resources. Each gatherable object can have multiple states, drop resources, respawn over time and more.

All you need to do is drop a Gatherables template into your scene, swap out and create art and configure some values to make them look and act the way you want.

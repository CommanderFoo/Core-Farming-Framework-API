# Player Lots

Player Lots offer a way for creators to define sections in their game that belong to individual Players. Lots can be mixed with several other systems and the main benefits they provide are ownership, permissions and persistence.

A Player can "own" any number of Player Lots, and Lots can exist only while the owner is online, or stay even after they leave the game.

Lots can even be combined with Areas to let you create pools of Area/Lots that dynamically load and unload as Players enter and exit them. This is used to create things like the interior of a Players house that only loads when a Player enters it.

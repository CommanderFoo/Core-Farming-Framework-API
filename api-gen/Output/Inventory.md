# Inventory

Inventory is a drop in system that provides ready to go Player Inventory management without any code required. It also provides a full API for creators with scripting knowledge to allow them to expand on or change how the Inventory works.

The Inventory comes with a few potential setups. You can use a combined Inventory and Hotbar, Hotbar or individual Inventory Settings templates to create the Inventory you want for your game.

Inventory items can be dragged and dropped across Inventories. Items can also be dropped into the world or destroyed by being dropped on the trash icon in the provided UI.

Clicking Items that have been configured to be Equipment will optionally equip the item. Other custom actions could be created by listening for the Events that the Inventory broadcasts.

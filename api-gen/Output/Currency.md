# Currency

Currency is a drop in system that provides ready to go Player Currency management without any code required. It also provides a full API for creators with scripting knowledge to allow them to expand on or change how the Currency works.

Any amount of Currencies can be added to a game and you can use them for more than just visible currency amounts.
For example, a Currency could be used to track the scores in a game.

local coinsMultiplier = 2
local currency = "coins"

local function OnCurrencyAdded(player, currencyId, amountAdded)
    if coinsMultiplier > 1 and currencyId == currency and CURRENCY.HasRoomForCurrency(player, currencyId, amountAdded) then
        local currentAmount = CURRENCY.GetCurrencyAmount(player, currencyId)

        CURRENCY.SetCurrencyAmount(player, currencyId, currentAmount + (amountAdded * coinsMultiplier))
    end
end

Events.Connect(CURRENCY.Events.CurrencyAdded, OnCurrencyAdded)

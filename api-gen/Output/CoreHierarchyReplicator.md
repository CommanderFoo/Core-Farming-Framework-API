| `CreateInstance(string)` | `instance` | Creates a new instance table but doesn't register it. See API.AddInstance. | None |
| `DeactivateReplicator(string, boolean|nil)` | `None` | On the server, this will deactivate a replicator and all players will have their instances removed. | None |

| `GetCurrentInstance()` | `None` | If called during the spawning of an instance, will return the instance, else nil. | None |
| `GetInitialBufferString(string)` | `string @Non human readable bit string` | Gives you a string of all the instances in the buffer after initialization. Server only. | None |
| `GetInstance(CoreObject)` | `instance` | Finds the instance associated with this core object. | None |
